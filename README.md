# Dotfiles!

I got tired of copying and pasting dotfiles, or forgoing my tooling on new systems. This solves that problem. Just run one command, and it will install everything (list below)! Ta-da ðŸŽ‰!

This repo started life as [gjunkie's dotfiles-starter-kit](https://github.com/gjunkie/dotfiles-starter-kit/blob/main/install), but has been added to and modified significantly. It also takes some bits from [jotyGill's ezsh](https://github.com/jotyGill/ezsh).

## Install

```bash
bash -c "$(wget --quiet https://raw.github.com/bscholer/dotfiles/master/install.sh -O -)"
```
